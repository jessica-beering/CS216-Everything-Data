a) The average age of US Representatives in Hawaii is 82.3. 

b) SQL Query 

CREATE VIEW HI_members AS
SELECT p.id, p.first_name, p.last_name, (date_part('year', current_date) - date_part('year', p.birthday)) AS age,
	r.type, r.state
FROM persons p, person_roles r
WHERE p.id = r.person_id AND r.type = 'rep' AND r.state = 'HI';

SELECT state, COUNT(*), AVG(age)
FROM HI_members 
GROUP BY state;

c) There are only 2 representatives in Hawaii so this is not worth an average.
